# Organization Of The Submission

All the code/experiments can be found in the `src` folder. There are multiple jupyter notebooks, which contain code for the various models trained on the two datasets. 

**The `data` folder houses the initial dataset in CSV format, which was sourced from the research paper [Mental Emotional Sentiment Classification with an EEG-based Brain-machine Interface](http://jordanjamesbird.com/publications/Mental-Emotional-Sentiment-Classification-with-an-EEG-based-Brain-machine-Interface.pdf) by Jordan James Bird.**

The [second dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/phhasian0710/seed-iv/data) is too large to be downloaded directly, so the link to the dataset is provided. A detailed description of the dataset can be found in the presentation slides which are included in the `report` folder.
